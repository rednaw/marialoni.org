## Description
The goal of the trajectory is to provide ILLC PhD candidates with information, training and extra support in their first year. It includes two soft skills courses,  a DEI training and a number of lectures illustrating different research lines within ILLC.  

## Organisation
* Mandatory for 1st year ILLC PhD candidates (excluding CWI);
* Start in September 2025;
* New PhDs can join all year long. If they miss one (obligatory) session in year 1, they can follow it in year 2;
* Monthly meetings with a scientific + transferrable skills programme, some of the sessions open to the whole PhD community:

1. Introduction [September]
2. DEI/active bystander training (with supervisors) offered by [Our Bodies, Our Voice](https://www.ourbodies-ourvoice.com/) [October]
3. [LoLaCo lectures](https://studiegids.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2025-2026/zoek-vak/vak/130027) [September-December]: at least 3 lecturers obligatory. The  lectures can be followed in different years although it is advisable to complete the assignment in year 1. Deadline to submit report in 2025/26: 15 December 2025. The report consists a short summary (max 100 words) of the 3 lectures attended. Submission is via email to m.d.aloni@uva.nl, subject: LoLaCo report 2025.  
4. ILLC PhD day [January]:  (Poster) presentations given by new and senior ILLC PhD candidates. PhD candidates who want to present their work should submit their abstract via email to phd-illc@uva.nl by 31 December 2025. Abstracts should be max one page long and clearly indicate whether the submission is for a talk or a poster presentation. First-year PhD candidates (those who started in 2025) are further expected to give a short (max 3 minute) one single static slide presentation to introduce themselves to the ILLC community.   
5. Academic writing  [May-June]: The Academic Writing training will be offered by senior ILLC researchers representative of different areas of ILLC (in 2026, [Krzysztof R. Apt](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~apt/), [Martin Stokhof](https://stokhof.org) and [Khalil Sima'an](https://sites.google.com/site/khalilsimaaan/home/computational-linguistics)) and will include plenary presentations by the instructors and individual feedback on writing samples submitted in adavnce by the participants.
