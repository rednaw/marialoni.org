## Course description
The goal of the MoL graduation trajectory is to provide 2nd year MoL students information and extra support in their final year. It includes a number of **information meetings** (on MoL graduation procedure, PhD applications, life after ILLC), some **trainings** (how to write a cv/research proposal, how to write a MoL thesis), and a number of sessions where ILLC researchers present **possible thesis topics** to the graduating students. The trajectory further includes two kinds of **student presentations**:  

* MoL thesis presentations (mandatory for graduating students, where students present their ongoing thesis project to the ILLC community) 
* January presentations (more informal where students present their thesis topic to each other)

NOTE: The trajectory is designed for 2nd year MoL students who intend to graduate in the second semester. But also for students starting their thesis writing semester in September, who intend to graduate in the first semester. Students from other cohorts or Logic Year students are also welcome to attend the sessions (in particular the research units presentations). Also 2nd year students who intend to take an extra semester can follow the trajectory this year [advisable for those components that will come too late for them next year such as the research seminars, the January presentations, how to write a MoL thesis] but will have to do their MoL thesis presentation in the next fall.
