**A Corpus of Indefinite Uses**

The Corpus of Indefinite Uses is an output of the project [Indefinites and beyond. Evolutionary pragmatics and typological semantics](/Indefinites).  It makes available data collected and annotated in the course of a cross-linguistic synchronic and diachronic corpus study of indefinite expressions. 

The corpus contains data for the following languages and forms:

Synchronic 
- German *irgend* series
- Italian *(uno) qualunque*
- Spanish *cualquiera*
- Dutch *wh\* dan ook*
- Czech *kterykoli*
- English *any* and *some*

Diachronic
- German *irgend* series
- Spanish *cualquiera*
- Dutch *wh\* dan ook*

The indefinites have been annotated with the functions in an extended  version of  Haspelmath's (1997) semantic map proposed by Aguilar-Guevara et al. (2011). A description of the functions and the annotation procedure can be found in the [Annotation Guidelines](/resources/indefinites-annotation-guidelines.pdf). Aloni et al. (2012)  reports results on inter-annotator agreement. 

The corpus is searchable through an [online web interface](https://osf.io/z2j9e/) and is also available as raw data. 

Full documentation describing the organization of the database and the search functionality, as well as highlights of key results, is available [here](/resources/indefinites-documentation.pdf).
