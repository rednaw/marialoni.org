  Recent studies use semantic structural priming to show that various cases of linguistic strengthening 
  happen through a common mechanism: generation of implicatures through alternative-based (scalar) reasoning. In this 
  paper, we used priming to investigate another group of cases, where strengthening is postulated to follow from the 
  tendency to systematically neglect structures that verify a sentence by virtue of an empty configuration (neglect-zero):
  empty-set quantifiers ('at most/fewer than') and disjunction under a universal quantifier. We report data indicating 
  semantic priming between these two structures, but not between them and scalar 'some'. We propose that 1. there is 
  a common mechanism in use for strengthening constructions postulated to follow from the neglect-zero tendency, and that 
  2. this mechanism is different from the one involved in alternative-based reasoning.

  Plain disjunctive sentences, such as The mystery box contains a blue ball or a yellow ball, typically imply that
  the speaker does not know which of the two disjuncts is true. This is known as an ignorance inference. We can distinguish
  between two aspects of this inference: the negated universal upper bound part (i.e., the speaker is uncertain about each disjunct),
  which we call uncertainty, and the existential lower bound part (i.e., the speaker considers each disjunct possible), which we
  call possibility. In the traditional approach, uncertainty is derived as a primary implicature, from which possibility follows.
  In this paper, we report on two experiments using a sentence-picture verification task based on the mystery box paradigm that
  challenge the traditional implicature approach. Our findings show that possibility can arise without uncertainty, and we thus
  call for a reevaluation of the traditional view of disjunction and ignorance inferences. Our experimental findings are related
  to similar results involving disjunction in embedded contexts and pave the way for alternative theories that can account for
  the observed patterns of inference derivation in a unified fashion. We discuss how recent implicature and non-implicature theories
  can account for the derivation of existential lower bound inferences without the presence of negated universal upper bound inferences.

  Indefinites are known to give rise to different scopal (specific vs nonspecific) and epistemic (known vs unknown) uses.
  Farkas & Brasoveanu (2020) explained these specificity distinctions in terms of stability vs. variability in value

  The article investigates the diachronic development of irgend-indefinites in the German language. 
  Most scholars assume that the particle irgend emerged from the Old High German form io-wergin with a locative meaning
  similar to anywhere/somewhere. We present the result of corpus studies covering Middle High German, Early New High German and Present Day German.
  In view of our findings, we conjecture four stages in the development of irgend
  from a locative particle to a modifier of an indefinite: (Phase 1) in Old High
  German till Early Middle High German the particle irgend is a non-specific
  existential expression with a locative meaning; (Phase 2) in Classical Middle
  High German the particle is still a non-specific existential, but is no longer
  necessarily locative; (Phase 3) in Early New High German the first indefinite
  modifier uses emerge expressing semantic variation; in this process the particle
  loses its existential force and keeps only non-specificity (semantic variation)
  as its lexical contribution; (Phase 4) the indefinite modifier acquires new functions and establishes
  its current wide distribution, which includes semantic
  variation (non-specificity) as well as pragmatic variation (ignorance effect).
  The article aims to offer some insights on how an indefinite emerges and extends
  its use to new functions and which steps might be necessary for such an
  extension of use. We conjecture that some bleaching in the lexical contribution
  of irgend took place during this development.

  Free choice inferences represent a much discussed case of a divergence between logic and language (Kamp 1973, Zimmermann 2000).
  Grice influentially argued that the assumption that such divergence does in fact exist is a mistake originating “from inadequate attention
  to the nature and importance of the conditions governing conversation” (Grice 1989: 24). I will first show that when applied to free choice
  phenomena, the standard implementation of Grice’s view, representing semantics and pragmatics as two separate components, is empirically
  inadequate. I will then propose a different account: a bilateral state-based modal logic modelling next to literal meanings also pragmatic
  factors and the additional inferences that arise from their interaction. The pragmatic factor I will consider connects to a tendency of
  language users to neglect empty configurations when engaging in linguistic interpretation. The non-emptiness atom (ne) from team semantics
  provides a perspicuous way to formally represent this tendency and to rigorously study its impact on interpretation. In terms of ne, I will
  define a pragmatic enrichment function and show that, in interaction with disjunction occurring in positive contexts and only in these cases,
  pragmatic enrichment yields non-trivial effects including predicting free choice inferences and their cancellation under negation. The latter
  result relies on the adopted bilateralism, where each connective comes with an assertion and a rejection condition and negation is defined in
  terms of the latter notion.

  This article proposes an account of knowing-who constructions within a

  knowing-wh constructions (Boer and Lycan, 1985), as well as expresses non-trivial cases of so-called concealed questions (Heim, 1979).
  Assuming that quantifying into epistemic contexts and knowing-who are linked in the way Hintikka had proposed, the context dependence
  of the latter will translate into a context dependence of de re attitude ascriptions and this will result in a ready account of a number
  of traditionally problematic cases including Quine’s well-known double vision puzzles (Quine, 1956).

  meanings. To derive implicature, Grice’s conversational maxims, and an additional principle expressing preferences
  for minimal models, are formulated as violable constraints used to select optimal candidates out of a set of alternative
  sentence-context pairs. The implicatures of an utterance of φ are then defined as the sentences which are entailed by any
  optimal context for φ (but not by φ itself). Entailment is defined in a version of update semantics where contextual
  updates are derived by competition among contexts. Free choice and other modal implicatures of disjunctions and indefinites
  will follow, but also scalar implicatures and exhaustification.

  A dynamic view on meanings as context change potentials provides a substantial account of the dependence of focused answers
  on the context set up by their preceding questions. Questions pose conditions on the focal structure of their answers and
  can further restrict the domain of subsequent focusing operators like only. Standard analyses of focus define congruence in
  terms of identity between the question meaning and the focal alternatives of the answer. Most existing dynamic analyses of
  questions have been developed in the tradition of the partition theory of Groenendijk and Stokhof. This chapter presents update
  semantics of questions and focuses building on Gawron's dynamic model of domain restriction. It describes how dynamic analysis
  gives an interesting characterization of the notion of discourse congruence which covers contextual restrictions. Finally, the
  chapter explains how questions can restrict the domain of quantificational sentences used later in a discourse within dynamic semantics.

  With this introduction we aim to give a sketch of the research area
  in which questions are studied from the perspective of a semanticist,
  a formal linguist interested in the notion of 'meaning'. We start with
  explaining some general notions and insights in this area, and then
  zoom in on one of the most influential theories about questions, the
  partition theory of Groenendijk and Stokhof (section 1.1). In section
  1.2 we concisely discuss some alternatives to the partition semantics,
  and some current issues in the debate about the meanings of questions,
  which will also pop up every now and then in the contributions to
  this volume. Then, in section 1.3, we have a thematic discussion of the
  contributions to this volume themselves, considering them one by one
  and in relation to each other. We end (section 1.4) with a sketch of
  some issues which, we think, still abide or have arisen from this volume

  Extending the proposal made by Schulz (2003), we put forward a pragmatic
  account of the meaning of existential and universal FC items, where the 'ignorance or
  indifference' inference triggered by the former and the 'universal' inference triggered
  by the latter are treated as implicatures obtained by standard gricean reasoning
  formalized in terms of the two operations grice and competence. On this account,
  the implicatures of a sentence are generated with respect to a number of relevant
  alternatives. The difference between existential and universal FCs is due only to
  the choice of these alternatives.

  This paper offers an account of the fact that certain verbs license wh-questions as their complement but not
  whether-questions. For instance, it is felicitous to say It is surprising who Bill had invited but not to say It is surprising
  whether Bill had invited his wife. We refer to this contrast as the *whether puzzle. We propose an account which crucially
  rests on the assumption that the relevant kind of verbs are sensitive to the semantic objects that their complement clause brings
  into salience, rather than just its truth/resolution conditions. It has been argued in previous work that the semantic objects
  that matrix questions bring into salience are important to understand the role of such questions in discourse. The present paper is,
  to the best of our knowledge, the first to argue that this aspect of meaning is also crucial for understanding the role of embedded
  questions in grammar.

  This paper proposes a semantics for declarative and interrogative complements
  and for so-called responsive verbs, like know and forget, which embed both kinds of
  complements. Following Groenendijk & Stokhof (1984), we pursue a uniform account
  in the sense that we take both kinds of complements to be of the same semantic
  type and we assume a single lexical entry for each responsive verb. This approach
  avoids a number of problems for non-uniform theories, such as the reductive theories
  of Karttunen (1977), Heim (1994), Lahiri (2002), Spector & Egré (2015), among
  others, and the twin relations theory of George (2011).
  On the other hand, our account also addresses the main limitation of Groenendijk
  & Stokhof’s (1984) proposal, which is that it is primarily designed to derive strongly
  exhaustive readings for interrogative complements. Our account is more flexible in
  that it straightforwardly derives non-exhaustive and intermediate exhaustive readings
  as well.

  Indefinites display a great functional variety and they give rise to different pragmatic effects. We focus on free
  choice indefinites and in particular on the Italian qualsiasi. Our aim is to reconstruct the grammaticalization path of this
  item and understand how diachronic data might shed some light on existing semantic theories of free choice. We employ corpus-based
  tools to build a database containing occurrences of qualsiasi from its origin and early forms to its current usage. We show that
  qualsiasi emerged from a particular unconditional construction and we outline the different stages which led to its grammaticalization.
  We analyze the compatibility of our diachronic study with formal accounts of free choice inferences, with a focus on Alternative Semantics
  analyses for indefinite pronouns and so-called grammatical theories of free choice. Our work shows that an integration between formal
  semantics and historical linguistics is fruitful and worth pursuing.

  We discuss the ‘problem of convergent knowledge’, an argument presented by J. Schaffer in favour of contextualism about
  knowledge attributions, and against the idea that knowledge‐wh can be simply reduced to knowledge of the proposition answering
  the question. Schaffer's argument centrally involves alternative questions of the form 'whether A or B'. We propose an analysis
  of these on which the problem of convergent knowledge does not arise. While alternative questions can contextually restrict the
  possibilities relevant for knowledge attributions, what Schaffer's puzzle reveals is a pragmatic ambiguity in what 'knowing the answer'
  means: in his problematic cases, the subject knows only a partial answer to the question. This partial knowledge can be counted as
  adequate only on externalist grounds.

  The study of questions and answers is challenging for various fields of theoretical linguistics,
  logic, analytical philosophy, and more recently computer science. Research into questions and answers addresses
  old and raises new and important questions about the semantics / pragmatics interface and about the dynamics of
  interpretation. This book brings together current work on the topic as it has been developed in Amsterdam,
  and congenial academic sites, over the past 15 years. Amsterdam is one of the breeding grounds for the formal study
  of logic and language, for dynamic semantics, and for the study of questions and answers. It covers the major issues
  of pragmatic/semantic investigation, including logical relations, context dependence, information structure, and more.
  It illustrates how semantic/pragmatic stance can be used for problems in other areas of linguistic theorising.
