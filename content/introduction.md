## Course description
The course is intended primarily for students who wish to do the [Minor Logic and Computation](https://www.illc.uva.nl/MinorLoCo/) but who have not yet followed an introductory course to logic. Students are expected to cover the course material by self-study alone. The written exam will assess students' knowledge of the following topics:<br><br>

- Propositional logic
  - Syntax, semantics
  - Functional completeness
  - Logical validity
  - Truth Tables
  - Natural deduction
- Predicate logic
  - Syntax, semantics
  - Interpretation by Substitution
  - Logical validity
  - Identity
  - Properties of Relations
  - Natural deduction (for predicate logic without identity)

## Literature
You are free to choose your own textbook. There are many excellent introductions to logic available. However, for this course we recommend everybody to read<br><br>

- The first four chapters to the textbook of the course [Logic in Action](https://logicinaction.org/).

In addition, read,<br><br>

- Chapters 1-4 of Logic, _Language and Meaning. Introduction to Logic_, Volume 1, by L.T.F. Gamut. University of Chicago Press.

Or<br><br>

- Chapters 0-2 of _Logic and Structure_, by Dirk van Dalen. Springer

The book by Gamut is written with an eye towards applications in linguistics, whereas the book by van Dalen has a more technical style suitable for students with a background in mathematics or computer science.
